## Introduction
In this post I'm going to show you how to access the world's greatest libraries of books. I'm fortunate enough to live in Boston and have access to both the Boston Public Library and the Harvard library and I still frequently use the resources that I'm about to show you.

## Project Gutenburg
[Project Gutenburg](http://www.gutenberg.org/) is an attempt to catalog and distribute every book that is no longer under copyright and now within the public domain. It has novels like [Melville's Moby Dick](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2701), and poems by [Dickenson](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12242) in a wide variety of digital formats. With over 56,000 free ebooks all published before 1923 Project Gutenburg is a veritable archive of works that have fallen into the public domain. (Though double check which version you receive. I once accidentally read the abridged version of [Crime and Punishment](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2554)!)

## Libgen
If Project Gutenburg is the stereotypical stuffy librarian that extoles the classics, [libgen](libgen.io) is the punk librarian trying to set the establishment on fire. You can find almost any popular book on there in a wide variety of formats there's only one catch: **you can't legally share almost anything you get from libgen.io**.

Why is this? Well, copyright law in the United States *only forbids unlawful distribution of copyrighted materials. It doesn't forbid receiving those unlawfully distributed, copyrighted materials.*

This mean's that libgen is assuming a huge amount of liability in sharing these books with you but unless you start sharing them too you haven't broken any laws.

 Now **I am not a lawyer**. I may be wrong about this. Maybe there's some lawyer out there who agrees or disagrees with me. If any lawyer out there would like to follow up on this further please let me know.

 To use libgen just search via title, author, or ISBN. I'm sure you'll find something if it's not too esoteric.
