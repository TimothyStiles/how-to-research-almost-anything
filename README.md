# How to Research Almost Anything

by [@timothystiles](https://twitter.com/TimothyStiles)

## Introduction
I wrote this tutorial series to help new community lab members get started with accessing MOOCs, textbooks, and scientific papers. It's geared towards biologists and computer scientists but anyone should be able to follow along if they've used the command line before (only required for the first tutorial). Follow along and learn how to access millions of books, papers, and MOOCs for free!

This series will teach you:

1. [How to download tutorials and course material from youtube, edx, and coursera.](01-download-moocs.md)
2. [How to find almost any book with libgen and the gutenburg project.](02-find-almost-any-book.md)
3. [How to access almost any scientific article with sci-hub, unpaywall, and the openaccess button.](03-access-almost-any-scientific-paper.md)
